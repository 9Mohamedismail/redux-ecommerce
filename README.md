# REDUX E-COMMERCE

This project was created to practice using Redux-toolkit as well as middleware with API calls. Using the API "https://fakestoreapi.com/" a user is able to add items to a cart, view their cart, as well as delete items from their cart. Additionally, using Redux the ability to see the process of the API calls is implemented. Thus, when the API call is pending, the user will see "Loading...". When the API call is rejected, the user will see a message.
